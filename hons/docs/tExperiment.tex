\subsection{Correct Functioning of Mechanisms}

First we must show the correct recovery of the system after thee occurance of a fault.
These are the most basic kinds of experiments and are very controlled.
Our simulator uses mostly randomly-generated graphs as problem instances, so we devise a simple deterministic invocation behaviour which allows us to determine if the fault-tolerant are working correctly.
