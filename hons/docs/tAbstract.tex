The streaming paradigm provides powerful solutions to many modern high-performance computations, due mainly to the ease of decomposing computations into large-grained parallel executing units.
As such, attention is focused on developing robust and extensible frameworks to allow streaming computations to run on heterogeneous networked (cloud) systems.

This thesis looks to the provisioun of fault-tolerance over such a framework running on the cloud.
We develop the SDFSimulator, which represents arbitrary cloud machines and simulates faults and recovery mechanisms which occur dynamically during the execution of stream programs.
We analyse the problem of assigning computational units (actors) to the processors on such a system whilst respecting certain constraints imposed by the necessity for fault tolerance, and together with proving that problem to be NP-Hard, we provide a heuristic solver which performs on average 10\% worse than the optimal solution under realistic and totally random tests.
