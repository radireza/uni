This thesis was only made possible by the support and expertise of the Sydney Programming Languages group.
First I thank my supervisor Dr. Bernhard Scholz.
His expertise and familiarity with this are helped me find my way through the quagmire of knowledge.
In this short year i have learned more about the challenges facing computation than i every would have thought.
I thank him for keeping me on-track and well informed.

Also, i thank Dr. Andrew Santosa and S.M. Farhad.
Andrew's tireless efforts in editing and helpful suggestions made sure we got to the finish line in good form.
I thank him for the revising and the re-revising, and teaching me the meaning of the term {\em formal proof}.
Farhad's tutorials on the basics of SDF and the intricacies of AMPL were invaluable.
I thank him for the head-start he gave me in my experimental work.

Finally, i thank all the members of the Sydney Programming Languages group, my family, and the School of IT.
Without whom, studying this year, and my thesis, would not have been possible.
