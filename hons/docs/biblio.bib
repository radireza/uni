     abstract = {This paper gives a graph-theoretic model for the description and analysis of parallel computations. Within the model, computation steps correspond to nodes of a graph, and dependency between computation steps is represented by branches with which queues of data are associated. First, it is shown that each such computation graph G represents a unique computation, determined independently of operation times. Next, methods of determining whether such a computation terminates and of finding the number of performances of each computation step are developed. The maximal strongly connected subgraphs of G and the loops within these subgraphs play a central role in this analysis. For example, use is made of the result that either every computation step within a strongly connected subgraph of G is performed an infinite number of times, or none is. Finally, necessary and sufficient conditions for the lengths of data queues to remain bounded are derived.},
