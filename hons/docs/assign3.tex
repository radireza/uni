\section{Literature Review}

this is so much unwin.

\subsection{SDF}

This reference \cite{rofl} shouldn't work.
This one works though \cite{sdfBook}.
Run out the line so we can at least get a newline.

Now for a biiiig citation \cite{ran75} woops.
I wonder if we were to keep on writing what would happen.
I really should read \cite{sih91}.
Maybe i should write one of those meta-ethics tritisms here.
What does inproceedings \cite{son10} look like?

\subsection{Scheduling}


\subsection{Fault Tolerance}


\section{Research Proposal}

MOAR unwin.
