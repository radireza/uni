page rank
	convergence, optimizing backlinks
	random walk on linked structure to measure some properties
	an incoming link is a 'vote of importance', outgoing liks from important nodes are more important
	usually a surfur goes from a page to an outlink (p=a)
	occasionally a surfur zaps to a distant link (p=1-a)
	may be biased to centain preferences, walk to links in plaintext, not image links, zap to homepages
	markov chain P=((1-a, b), (a, 1-b)) Transpose of normal
	x^i_k+1 = SUM(j)(PijX_k)
	location at any time computer by powers of matrix by initial state (we start in elem 1, so state is (1, 0)
	probabilities approach 50/50

	transigion G= ((0,1,0), (1,0,0), (1,0,0))
	scale all probs by alpha, replace all sinks with 1/n, all non-sinks add an extra (1-a)/n
	G= ((0,1,0), (1,0,1), (1,0,0)), pow21
	
	A = aGD^p
	markov chain is strongly connected if path from every to every
	aperiodic
	if we powr a matrix ad infinitum, all elements fix
	at each step, minimum elem in row can only increase, max can only decrease
	m t+1 = min(j)p^(t+1)_ij, M and m converge regardless of starting point, dM_t + (1-d)m_t

	web-like graphs make the computation very easy

Link building
	we want to add a small k new links, hard to approximate, non polynomial, constant approximation
	look at greedy lower bound, chookse k highest ranked pages
	takinga  link lowers the page rank of others
	naive is at leats 13.8 times worse than optimal for a = .85
