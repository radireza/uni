voronoi diagrams
	partition the plane into regions closest to the given control point
	Vor(p) is the division of the plane into n cells 
	for 2 cells, draw the line between them, mark p as the middle point, the cells bordered by the line perpendicular to the joining segment going through p

properties:
	a cell is the intersection of one or more halfplanes
	if p is colinear, the diagram is a set of parallel lines, otherwise the diagram is segments and half-lines
	the size of vof)p) is at most quadratic, each cell has <= n-1 edges
	for n >= 3 the number of vertices in Vor(P) is <= 2n - 5 and the number of edges is <3n-6
	We use euler's formula for conencted plane graphs: v-e+f=2 (faces: regions bounded by an unbroken cycle, including the ourside)
	bend all infinite edges to meet a new vertex, nv+1 vertices
	number of edges is unchanged, num faces same as num sites:
	(nv + 1) - ne + n = 2
	2ne >= 3.(nv + 1) <- lower bound for number of edges

	let q be a point, , the largest empty with respect to q is a circle with centre q that does not contain any site
	q is a vertex in the voronoi diagram if it contains 3 or more points in the empty
	the half-line bisectors emanating from q form edges of vor(p)
	the bisector between 2 points exists only if there is a q in the line whose largest empty circle has both points on it

Fortune's algorithm (sweep line, O(n log n))
	cant do better than n log n, reduce sorting to voronoi, which has lower bound n log n
	problem: when sweeping from top to bottom, the part of vor(p) above the sweep line l depends partially on sides below s
	solution: we dont keep track of the voronoi diagram so far, only what parts of the diagram can't be changed
	observation: if the any point q is closer to a site than the sweep line, then q must belong to the cell, since no point added below the line can be closer
	intersection of parabolic arcs behind the seep line are called break points.  the beach line is x monotone
	intersection of 2 arcs trace out the edges of the voronoi diagrams
	Sweep from top to bottom stop at events
		site events, ordered sites - trace out edges in the voronoi diagram
		circle events, an existing arc shrinks and disappears from the beachhead
	the only way a new arc can appear on the sweep line is through a site event
	each new site can only add 1 arc and can only split 1 arc into 2
	when 3 arcs coalesce, one gets smaller and smaller until it disappears, we observe the 2 outer arcs cat be from the same parabola
	the only way ane xisting arc can disappear from the beachead is in a circle event
	each new site adds up to 3 new consecutive triples
	false alarm, largest consecutive triple until another site pops up and is inside the triple
	Every voronoi vertex is detected by a circle event

	use BST to insert, delete, keep ordered
	priority queue for events, sorted by y coordinate
	somehow to store the actual voronoi diagram: doubly connected edge list

	when q is empty but Y perhaps not, the remaining arcs form the infinite edges
