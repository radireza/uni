convex set
a subset S of the plane is a convex set if for an P and Q in S the line between P and Q is completely contained in the set
convex hull is the smallest 

the Ch of a set of points S in d dimenstions is the union of all convex combinations of d+1 points of s

d=2, convex combination of 3 points, a triangle

a point is in the convex hull if it lies within the triangle of any 3 other points
inefficient: find a triangle, check if a point is in it, order n^4

the CH of S is the intersection of all halfspaces that contain s
intersection of two convex sets is a convex set, union is not necessarily
choose xy such that all points lie on one side of xy, each xy where all other points lie on one side is in CH
(qx-px)(ry-py) //DO THIS

find lowest y point, presume we have a start edge horizontal on x axis
for each other point, find one with largest angle, choose it as next point

Sweep line
	take all pointss sorted left to right
	put leftmost in convex hull, keep adding
	if a point forces hull to be reflex, backtrack till the hull is convex
	computes upper hull, merge with lower hull
	nlogn (dominated by sort)
	
Divide and conquer
	nlogn
	T(n) = O(n) + 2T(n/2) + O(n)

lower bound than (n log n)
	prove a lower bound use a reduction from sorting
	sorting omega(n log n)
	SEE SLIDES
	
Segment Intersection
	brute force is optimal if all intersections must be reported
