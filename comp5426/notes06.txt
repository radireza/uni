partitioning and communication
	identify maximum degree of parallelism
	Agglomeration - partitioning phase where we group tasks, simplify program, improve performance, maintain scalability
	block cyclic distribution:
		partition into more blocks than processors
		round robin assign blocks to processors

Reduction
	given associative operator (xor)
	add, multiply, and or, min max
	parallel reduction: divide and conquer
	binomial tree of computation nodes, agglomeration is mip-mapped
