GPGPU
	2 orders of magnitude vs cpu
	not suitable for all kinds, truck vs motorbike
	same slides as prog-languages last year
	tera, dray, massively data parallel device
	no ieee standards, picels being off by a bit doesnt matter
	set of SIMD multiprocessors
	instruction stream, only 1 IU per SIMD (SPMD)
	different cache per multiprocessor
	hardware specialised for graphics, constant cache, texture cache
	threads dont access other threads, can access global/constant memory, textures
	kernel: work function, partition code into executable parts
		little synchronisation, barriers, atomics (semaphors)
		partitioned into grid of blocks, block made of threads
	difficulty shipping memory (pcie bus), colocate in future
