speed, throughput

implicit parallelism: super-scalar, pipelines

power = voltae^2 x frequecy
frequency = voltage
power = frequecy^3

parallel - top down
distributed - bottom up

cluster computing - group of linked computers working together
grid computing (cloud computing)

many operations take place at once, complicates reasoning about performance/correctness
