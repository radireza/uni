Memory bottleneck
	all processors can only access memory one at a time
	memory partition - banks, parallel access
	symmetric/asymmetric shared memory access
	distributed shared memory, each processor has direct access to its own memory, pass anothe rprocessors meory through it
	reduce shared variables for communication
	
cluster computer
	midleware makes it appear to be a single virtual system
	interconnects: fast ethernet gigabit, myrinet, infiniband

grid computer
	internet instead of loca (WAN vs LAN)

cloud computing
	X as a Service, everything is on a server
	pay as you go
	Virtualisation highly customised user environment, isolation to malicious software, migration of services

cloud vs grid
	manage large facilities over internet
	cloud: virtualization, business model, programming model - dynamic scale

interconnection networks
	carry data between processors
	static - when machine designed not when connection needed
	dynamic - connects on the fly

network topologies
	completely connected, all nodes connect to all other nodes, too hard to connect when many computers
	star connected, central bottleneck
	two and 3 dimensional meshes
