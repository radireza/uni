Parallel Architectures

Superscalar
	performance suffers if cant keep all units full
	data dependancy, resource dependancy, branch dependancy
	Scheduler - hardware looks at large instruction blocks and decides where to put them

Multicore
	gpu, many small cores, processor made of some large cores
		GPU: multiple cores utilise multithreading and Single Instruction Multiple Data
			gtx 280: 8 sp's in a multiprocessor, share some memory/registers, constant cache/texture cache/device memory
	Flynn's Taxonomy SISD, SIMD, MISD, MIMD
