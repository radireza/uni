Number theory problems
	discrete logarithm problem
	a^b modulo c
	shortcuts come in leaps and bounds, it is difficult to say the strength of a key
	believed to be difficult to find prime factors of large multiple of 2 primes, square root

Public key crypto
	deals with MUCH larger numbers (2048 bit keys)
	hybrid: use public keys to exchange, then switch to symmetric for speed
	able to brute force message space since we have the key

el gamal
	alice generates g, a nd p
	alive calculates g^a mod p
	alice's public key is p, g ad g^a which che can publish
	the variable a is the private key used to decrypt
	bob same with q, h, h^b
	to encrypt, y1 is g^k, y2 = (g^a)^k m mod p

RSA
	n = pq : phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1)
	ed = 1 mod phi(n)
	public: e, n
	private, d, p, q
	chinese remainder theorem - solve rsa by simultaneous equations
	factoring attack:
		c = m^e mod n
		if we can factor phi(n) we can break n
	small encryption exponent attack:
		choose 3 as the exponent, send 3 messages to different people with same exponent
		same for small decryption
	brute force message space
	homomorphic properties: c1c2 - (m1m2)^e mod n
		trick alice into decrypting double encrypted message, we can decrypt it if she sends it back unencrypted
	1039 bit prime was factored in 2007
	square and multiply, break g^23 into g^16.g^4.g^2.g^1
