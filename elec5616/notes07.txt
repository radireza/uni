Secret splitting
	s = m xor r
	malleable: part recipients can mess with the data by modifying their bit
	everyone knows how long the message is, all are required to reassemble the message (bus factor=1)
	(3,5)-threshold scheme, (bus factor=3) 3/5 ppl needed to reconstruct scheme
	polynomial of degree n can be completely defined by n+1 points, m = a0 = f(0)

bit commitment
	bob sens random r, alice sends {r|m}_k
	also with hash function

Fair coin flip
	Alice commits to a random bit, hashes with random, bobtries to guess
	least significant bit of f(x) cant be related to x
	RSA commutative function: e(e(x, a), b) = e(e(x, b), a)
	problematic because bob knows first, can use this information while alice waits

poker
	similar schemes as above
	quadratic residue: if y^2 = x (mod p) has a solution, then it has a solution when encrypted, make all aces quadratic residues so you know when bob pulls an ace, bob can check they arent QRs

Oblivious transfer
	bob is trying to factor a 2000 bit number, wants to buy 500 of alice's 1000 bits without alice knowing which bits
	bob ends a key and a random, alice encrypts with both but bob will only make sense of one, alice wont know which one bob makes sense of.
	can use zero knowledge proof to determine that n is indeed a factor, this is complicated maths

Subliminal channels
	messages hidden in the clear - steganography (THERES A CAT IN THIS TREE)
	write a sentance, if it has even number of words thats 0, otherwise 1

Firesmithing
	send a request to google to forward your request using http fields, many webservices do this kind of thing
	pretty much impossible to stop this, there are services that do this for a living

Credit-cards and cheques
	copy, some people wont cancel, make alot of money	
	banks closing down branches, online transactions, paypal
	e-cash not liked by governments, impossible to 'follow the money' makes money alundering redundant
	identifiable: no tax return

properties
	independant, private, anonymous, uncheatable
	offline payment, transferrability, divisibility, security
	withdrawal, spending, deposit, transfer
	prevent double spending, double depositing
