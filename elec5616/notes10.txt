IPSec
	authentication header, security assosiation: session keys, algo names
	encapsulated security payload
Address resolution protocol
	packet checks cache for mac to ip mapping, if not broadcasts
	malarie poisons cache, alice and bob think malarie is the other
	we can hard code in mac, loose configurability
Attack on DNS
	/etc/hosts
	cache poisoning
	infrastructure attacks

increasing fidelity of AIs to impersonate humans
	cleverbot, mycybertwin

Wireless security
	most wireless networks are inside the firewall, unsophisticated users cant cope with high security
	Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) you cant match wired sec
		master key 40-104 bits shared a-priori, each packet (header | data) RC4 stream cipher, xor stream cipher
		problem if we repeat IV, passive attacks to decrypt traffic based on, birthday attack on IV, max 5288 packets
		implementation is broken, standard doesnt say how to gen iv, starts at 0, memory tradeoff on IV, at most 24gb of space, changing iv with each packet is optional LOL
		crc32 as hash, cipher integrity check linear hash h(m xor k) = h(m) xor h(k), can make our own IC
		trick base statio to decrypt traffic, record trafic we want to decrypt, wait for iv one before it to arrive, resend on network
		reaction attack, fail tcp checksum if bits change using ack nack of tcp lyer, learn 1 bit at a time
software security
	buffer overflow
	canary, if overwritten problems
	timing attacks, algorithm return time (dont return straight away) bad c compiler
