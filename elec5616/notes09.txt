	alince sends nonce to trent
	trent says a blob alice cant decrypt, ticket
	bob has no guarantee that Kab is new
	eggshell model, not robust to internal faults

Network Security
	ddos, amplified ping on routers connecting, 16yo
	Strong authentication
	security is catch-up, reactive
	homogeneous, windows(linux) firefix, chrome, ie, android, iphone
	marshmallow model, protect the exterior
	attack is about leveraging access through trust

TCP IP
	ack, syn ack, syn
	packet sniffing, spoofing
	syn flooding, dos, exhaust a resource on machine
	smurfing, amplify message, icmp echo
	algorithm based attacks, run fast for avg case (hash table)
	sequence number prediction, open a connetion as mallory, use it to guess seq number when impersonating alice, jitter decreases with technology, this attack gets easier
	source routing
