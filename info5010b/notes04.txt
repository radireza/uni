f* optimal for (G, r, c) then f* is equilibrium for (G, r, c*), c*_e(x) = (xc_e(x))' = c_e(x) + xc'_e(x)
	price of anarchy bounded by P, 
	linear cost functions have constant bound (4/3)

brass paradox
	s (1) a (x) t
	s (x) b (1) t
	opt = eq = 3/2
	add a new link a (0) b
	opt = 3/2, eq = 2, anarchy = 4/3

tolls
	set to marginal cost of original network

equilibirum never costs more than an optimal routing twice as much

potential games
	game where we can define a porential function
	any potentiall game has pure equilibrium, best steps coverge to it

	directed graph, k players w source and dest, choose edges in g so there is a path
	player i wants a path s_i to t_i
	C(e) share cost of choosing edge between all players that use it

	exact potential function Phi(s1, s2...) - Phi(s1, s2...si'...) = ui(s1, s2...) - ui(s1, s2...si'...)
	if C(S)/A <= Phi(S) <= BC(S) then eq/opt <= A.B price of stability
	
	connection game: phi_e(S) = H_k cost(s)
