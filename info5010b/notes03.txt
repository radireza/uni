Inefficiency of equilibrium
	payoffs and objective functions
	selfish routing, routing
	price of anarchy/stability
	atomic and nonatomic
	
prisoner's dilema
	unstable, not 'socially' or pareto optimal
	equilibria != optimality
	(not LP, requires nonlinear quadratic constraints, zerosum games are LP)
	social (global payoff/cost for all players) - global (minimise total) egalitarian (minimise maximum)
	diff between equilibrium social cost and optiml social cost
	worst eq / optimal = price of anarchy, best eq / optimal = price of stability
	
Pigou's netork
	2 verts 2 directed edges
	traffic goes from source to terminal, splitable, 1 arc costs 1, other costs x
	equilibrium, all cars on x arc (wardrop)
	optimal, 1/2 1/2
	anarchy = stability : 4/3
	
shapley network design game
	directed graph g, every edge has cost C_e
	k players, each player at vertices s_i, t_i
	player i wants to establish connectivity with t_i
	player i must move from s_i to t_i along a path, paying c_e/f_e where f_e is number of players who decide to cross c_e
	all players connect to target with 1 and node b with epsilon, b connects to target by 1
		opt: all to b, ke + 1, each pays e+1/k, equilibrium as well as all alone
	make path to b cost 0, direct costs 1/(k+i), common = 1+epsilon
		opt 1+epsilon, each pays 1+epsilon/k BUT 
	
nonatomic selfish routing
	multicommodity flow network g
	source target pair commodities (s_k, t_k)
	demands r_i must be sent from s_i to t_i
	every edge has a delay function
	P_i paths from s_i to t_i, P= Union(i)(S_i)
	equilibrium: envy free, all flows use paths with the same delay (when split up)
	optimal, min social cost over all paths, 
	find potential function s.t. all minima are equilibria
	c*(x) = (x c(X))'
		i.e. make a new network with a cost function that makes people consider social cost
		c*(x) = C_e(X) + xC'_e(X)
		if you individually optimise for yourself + a social term then the equilibria is the optimal
	
	continuously decreasing, convex continuously differentiable
	potential function h(x) = intg(0-x)(c(x))
	all nonatomic has at least 1 equilibria, all equilibria have same cost
