solution concepts and computational issues
	each player has a set of strategies and a payoff function
	
	n players, m strategies, player i has utility ui = ui(s1, .., sn)
	(s1, s2,..., sn) is a nash equilibrium iff for all i=(1 to n)  ui(s1, ..., sn) >= ui(s1,...,si`,...,sn)
	
	battle of sexes, 2 stable (sport, sport) (opera, opera)
	doves and hawks, (hawk, dove)(dove, hawk)
	matching pennies, zero sum, no pure nash equilibria
	
	polution game - similar to n player prisoners
		reducing polution costs 3 + n(for n polluting countries) and n to keep poluting
		all countries pollute
	tragedy of the commons
		n players share a resource, max cpacity of 1, each player uses xi = [0, 1]
		if use exceeds caoacity no player gets any benefit, otherwise payoff is xi(1-sum(xj))
		player i maximises self x = (1-t)/2, all players use xi = 1/n+1
		total payoff is 1/n, if all users used 1/2 total would be 1/4
	
	dominant strategy, highest payoff independant of other strategies, if all players have one game has a dominant strategy solution
	pure nash equilibrium, ui(si, s-i) >= ui(si`, s-i)
		no player can individually increase their payoff
	mixed nash equilibrium
		randomized strategies: matching pennies (0.5, 0.5)
		(-1)pq + 1p(1-q) + 1(1-p)(q) + (-1)(1-p)(1-q)
		maxp minq (2p-1)(1-2q) <- (1/2, 1/2)
	
	mixed payoff
		player i chooses s1, s2 ... sm with probability ps1i, ps2i
		ui = sum(ps11, ps22, ps33...psnn . ui(s1,...,sn))
		
	2 person zero sum game
			a, -a | b, -b
			c, -c | d, -d
			
			A = | a b |
				| c d |
		exp payoff (row) p1aq1 + p2bq2 + p3cq3 + p4dq4 = (p1, p2) A (q1 | q2)
		players announcing strategies can expect <= to nash payoff
		since announcing strategy shouldnt change equilibrium, means is equal to nash
		prob dist will be unigue but more than one strategy can give same prob dist
	
	players {1, ..., n}
	each player has set of strategies Sj = {s1, s2, ..., sm}
	all strategy profiles S = S1 x S2 x ... x Sn
	each player chooses a distribution over Si: Pi in R^m
	p is nash eq iff forall ui(p) >= ui(si ; P-i) i.e. mixed is checked against pure, weighted average
