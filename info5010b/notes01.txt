prisoner's dilemma
	what is a reasonable thing to look for? (equilibrium)
	how do we find the solution? (both confess)
	
nash bargaining
	a offers (a, b) where a+b = 1
	b chooses to accept or reject
		b offers (a, b)
		ad infinitum
	disagreement point (x, y) not related to dollar
	x+y<1, a and b are actually splitting 1-x-y
	split leftover halfway
	
	several rounds, game ends after round with probability p>0
	2 rounds: b offers (x, 1-x) - (1-z, z)
		z = p.y + (1-p)(1-x) <- reserve price
	1 round: z=y
	many rounds: a:(a1, b1) b:(a2, b2) z:(a-, b-) d:(x, y)
		a offers b1 = b- [acceps b1 : rejects py + (1-p)(1-a2)]
			b1 = py + (1-p)b2
		b offers a2 = a- [accepts a2 : rejects py + (1-p)(1-a2)]
			a2 = px + (1-p)a1
		b1 = 1-a1 = (y+(1-p)(1-x))/2-p
		1/2 1/2 solution
