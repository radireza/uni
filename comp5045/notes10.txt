point triangulation
	try to make subtriangles fat
	triangulation depends on num triangles on conv. hull
	triangulate n pts, number of tris is m, k edges on c.h, Nf = m+1, Ne = (3m+k)/2
	Euler's forumula: |V| - |E| + Nf = 2: n-(3m+k)/2+(m+1) = 2 : m = 2n-2-k
	Ne = 3n - 3 - k
	for planar graphs k=3, e = 3n-6
	max the smallest angle in T
	m triangles, 3m angles, sort all angles a1, a2...a3m, A(t) is sorted all angles vector
	A(T) > A(T') iff all alphas less thn i are same, and A(T)i > A(T')i
	thales theoriem for any 4 points, abc lie on circle, abc < arc
	for any divided quad, edge pipj is illegal if the smallest angle it has is smaller than smallest in flip
	Angle vector of flipped triangulation always better, not sure how awful running time is
	
delauny
	dual of voronoi - delauny triangulation
	if we choose a delauny edge pipj and draw a disk,we know disk is empty, tij triangle with point at center of disk
	if a line pkpl crosses pipj, tkl is tri, but pi must lie inside tkl, then is not delauny, same if short edge intersects, all points on shortedge must belong to narpoint cell, intersection of shortedges
	therefore is planar graph
	a triangulation is delauny iff the circumcircle of any triangleis empty, i.e. voronoi
	a triangulation T is legal iff T is a delauny triangulation
		delauny is legal by definition
		find tilj with max angle ilj.  we know it cant be connected to pipj, so pm lies outside disk, mlj is bigger than ilj, contradiction
	delauny is unique, angle optimal is legal, therefore delauny is angle optimal

Min spanning tree
	1. compute delauny triangulation T
	2. compute MST of T
	prove all edges in mst is edge in delauny tri
	assume ab in mst not dt, a point c must be in ab disk or ab is delany edge, but if there is a c connected to b subgraph, remove ab, make ac, is smaller

mutual nearest neighbour graph
	edge ab exists if b is closest to a and a is closest to b
	mnn sub mst sub delauny

nearest neighbour
	conect p and q if q is nn of p
	
Relative neighbourhood
	connect edge if the region described by overlap 2 disks is empty
	mst sub relneigh

Gabriel graph
	add an edge pq if ther is a disk with diameter pq that is empty
	relneigh sub BB sub delauny
