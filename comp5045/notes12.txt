path queries on obstacles
	given a set of polygons in the plane: can i go from start to end? what is the shortest path from start to end?
	straight line segments, verticies are vertices of polygons ([half]disk of nonzero radius in free zone)
	vertices must be visible
	build visibility graph
visibility graph
	at most n^2 edges
	radial line sweep for each vertex O(n log n)
	can be O(n log n + |E|) (Ghosh and Mount 91)

is ther a path?
	trapezoidal decomposition, node in each cell and node on boundary of neighbouring cells, connect adjacent nodes
	num nodes is linear, 1 node per trapezoid (linear) and 2 per border
	point query on cells, can always go to node in cell, can go to adjacent cells, BFS
	but the robot is not a point: minkowski sum of 2 polygons, use previous approach
	minkowski sum is linear if both are convex, complexity explodes if not convex
	rotation, add 3rd dimension rotation, path corresponds
	multi link robots, add more dimensions

100 prisoners problem
	pick box corresponding to your number, follow the numbers in the boxes
	find my number find a cycle, if less 50 will find name
	there must be a cycle of length > 50 for execute
	2n prisoners, n boxes P_k = Prob of cycle length greater than k
	P_n = sum(k=n+1 to 2n) P_k -> can only have at most 1 50 cycle for 100 boxes
	P_k is number instances containing cycle length k / total num instances
		num subsets with k elements * num arrangementss of cycle * num permutations of 1n-k elemns / total num
		(2n c k) * (k-1)! * (2n-k)! / (2n)!
		(k-1)! / k! = 1/k
	sum(k = n+1 to 2n)(1/k) = H_2n - H_n < ln 2n - ln n = ln 2 = 0.307
