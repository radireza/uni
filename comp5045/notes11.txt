approximation
	euclidian tsp, max clique
	tsp: double MST, T <= 2.mst, mst < tsp, therefore T <= 2.tsp, 1.5 approx by shortcutting
	can 1+epsilon approximate in polynomial time O(n log^(oi) n).

heuristics: algos that do not give guaranteed approx, good in practice
approx algos: worst case bound, almost always get it

A is d approx if for every instance I with optimal solution OPT(I), A(I) <= d.OPT(I)
	poly-time approx. schemes (PTAS) 

Well separated Pair Decomposition
	A and B sets, each fit into r radius circle (CA and CB)
	well separated if distance is greater than s.r for separation constnt s.
	2 points p p' in a ball are at most 2r distance, 2 points pq larger than s.r
	pq >= s.r >= pp'.s/2
	pp' <= pq.2/s
	p'q' <= pp' + pq + qq' <= (1 + 4/s).pq

	given a set P of n pts in d-dimensional space, s>0
	WSPB for P wrt S is a sequence of well separated pairs {a1,b1}...{am,bm} s.t. for any to points p and q in P there is exactly 1 WSP {ai,bi} where p is in Ai and q is in bi
	there is a decomposition m = O(s^d n), compute in O(sn^d + n log n)
	closest pair(Q):
		compute WSPD (Q, s=4), set distabnce to infinity, for every well separated pair {ai,bi}
			if 1 point in both set pi=ai, qi=bi
			if dist > |pi qi| then dist = piqi, save piqi
		O(4^d n log n) + O(4^d n).
	t-spanner
		for all pair vertices pq shortest path between p and q is lesss than t times the euclidian distance
		can we compute spanner efficiently
		spanner (P,t), s = 4(t+1)/(t-1), calculate WSPD
		for each WSP: pick a point in ai and bi, add edgeand return
	proof: ind over rank of distances
		base case: shortest possible distance pq is closest pair, dist is less than pw since is euclidian shortest dist
		assume it holds for all pairs p`q`q where p`q` < pq
		p -> rep(ai) -> rep(bi) -> q, p->rep(ai) and rep(bi)->q less than previous step
		<= 2t.2/s.pq + (1 + 4/s . pq)
	point diameter
		compute WSPD wrt s = 4(1+e)/e, for every WSP aibi pick arbitrary points, dist is max over all arbitrary choosings
		approximation s = 4(1+e)/e, we report p`q` >= pq/(1+e)
