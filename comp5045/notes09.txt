Duality
	point to line, line to point
	(x,y) primal plane, (a,b)dual plane
	y=P_x . x - P_y -> y=2x-1
	l* = (Px,Py)dual -> (2,1) in dual
	(2,2)p -> b=2a-2

Self inverse: p = (p*)* (obviously)
Incidence preserving: if P lies on L in primal, L* lies on P* in dual
	we know Py = La . Px - Lb
	Lb = Px . La - Py, L* lies on P*
Order Reversing
	if P lies below L, then L* will lie below P*
	as we move a line parallel to L through P towards L, the slope cant change since its parallel, but the line rises and so intersection with y-plane shrinks
	
Upper Envolope
	dual of L is a point, intersection of p and q
	upper envelope -> lower convex hull (both envelopes -> full hulls)
	upper hull goes forward, lower hull goes backwards
	also intersection of halfplanes
	
Zone theorem
	vertex, edge, cell, set of lines
	(nc2)+n-1 <-> eulers formula
	zone: union of all cells intersected by L (query line), forms a polygon
	Complexity of the zone is O(n) -> 3n
	by induction:
		n=1, 2 zones, complexity=2
		for m=n-1 lines complexity of L is 3(n-1)
		ind.step:
			consider removing a line, it can only bound a cell to the right once (be a left edge), old left edges split by ln = 2
	each line takes O(n) time to process, sum is O(n^2)

minimal triangles
	input, n points in plane, find smallest area triangle with corners as points
	first point to the right of pair ab is min area triangle with ab as base
	dual (a,b), a* intersects (a, b)
	construct arrangement O(n^2), can do sweep line looking for points above below to determine in constant time
